# Thanks
Credit given for software used to build **Confidant** as well as inspirations.

---
## Vsevolod Stakhov
For [libucl](https://github.com/vstakhov/libucl); the fantastic and easy to use configuration language
and parser, as well as providing nice C++ bindings to it.

---
## René Ferdinand Rivera Morell
For [Lyra](https://github.com/bfgroup/lyra), the C++ command-line argument 
parsing library that **Confidant** uses which is elegant, easy to use and  
very flexible.

---
## Michael DeHann, The Ansible Community and Red Hat Inc.
For [Ansible](https://redhat.com/en/ansible-collaborative); Confidant's templating syntax was inspired by that of 
Ansible playbooks.

---
## Bob Glickstein, Guillaume Morin, Kahlil Hodgson, Adam Spiers
For [GNU Stow](https://gnu.org/software/stow) and the abstract implementation 
of symlink farm management, as many configuration managers derive their methods 
from this approach; including Confidant.
