# NAME

confidant - Your configuration pal and _confidant_

# SYNOPSIS

*confidant* [_action_] [..._options_]

# DESCRIPTION

*confidant* is a configuration file (or _dotfile_) manager, designed to ++
be focused, fast and easy to use; combining the practical ++ 
symlink-based approach of _GNU Stow_ with simple (but powerful) templating ++
syntax inspired by _Ansible_.

# SUBCOMMANDS

*init* [_path_] [_-d_,_--dry-run_]
	Initialize your dotfiles repository with a documented sample ++
	configuration file. The default is to operate on the current ++
	working directory.

*link* [_-f,--file_ *PATH*, _-d,--dry-run_, _-t,--tags_ *X,Y,Z*]
	Apply symlinks from your configuration file. To test and see ++
	what actions _would_ be taken, pass _-d_ or _--dry-run_. To specify ++
	a file other than the default (_./confidant.ucl_), pass the _-f_ ++
	or _--file_ options with the path to your desired file. ++
	You may apply tagged links and templates by passing _-t,--tags_ ++
	followed by a tag name or comma separated list of tag names.

*config* [_dump_, _get_]
	View and introspect your configuration

*config dump* [_-g,--global_, _j,--json_]
	Pretty-print your current configuration in full. To print out ++
	your global configuration, pass the _-g_ or _--global_ options. ++
	Passing _-j,--json_ outputs configuration in JSON format.

*config get* _name_ [_-g,--global_]
	Query your configuration file for the value of specific fields.++
	The _name_ may use periods to traverse nested fields, such as ++
	_repository.url_ or _links.foo.source_.

*help* [_subcommand_] [_init_, _link_, _config_ [_get_, _dump_]]
	Display general help, or _subcommand_ specific help info by ++
	passing the name of a subcommand as an argument, for example++
	*confidant help config get*.

*usage, -u,--usage*
	Display brief command-line usage info.

*version, -V,--version*
	Display version info.

# OPTIONS
These options may be passed anywhere in the command-line

*-v, --verbose*
	Overrides the global configuration setting to set _log-level_++
	to *trace*, outputting full debugging messages for all actions.

*-q, --quiet*
	Suppress all (non-fatal) messages from being displayed.

*-?, -h, --help*
	Display help information, may be _subcommand_ specific when ++
	passed after a subcommand.


# ENVIRONMENT

*NO_COLOR*
	When present and set to any value other than an empty string,++
	overrides your global _color_ setting, and disable the use of++
	any ansi escape sequences for color and/or text formatting. See++
	_https://no-color.org_ for more information about this community++
	standard.
