Installation
============

Head to the [releases page](https://codeberg.org/wreedb/confidant/releases) and grab the latest binary, currently only 
AMD64 (or 86_64 if you *love* underscores), are provided in binary form. The 
`-static` option is the simplest, since it has no runtime dependencies. The 
`.package.tar.xz` on the other hand contains the static binary, shell 
completions and manual page, which may be very useful; especially the 
completions.

Manual Installation
