Installation
============

Head to the [releases page](https://codeberg.org/wreedb/confidant/releases) and grab the latest binary, currently only 
AMD64 (or 86_64 if you *love* underscores), are provided in binary form. The 
`-static` option is the simplest, since it has no runtime dependencies. You 
may also be interested in the shell completions and manual pages, which are 
also available to download.

Manual Installation
-------------------

To manually build **Confidant**, see the [INSTALL.md](https://codeberg.org/wreedb/confidant/src/branch/main/INSTALL.md) document for
